## Backend to my [website](https://nathanjms.co.uk). 

### Features include:

A logged in user (via Firebase) with permissions (given manually by me currently) can access the Movies section, where they can:
- Add movies to watch
- Mark movies as watched
- See list of movies on watchlist and movies that have been watched
- See top IMDB Movies
- Random movie selector (Now implemented!)

Backend is hosted on Heroku, and the front end on Github Pages

**Note:** The is the 'forked' version that will be using postgresql instead of MongoDB.
